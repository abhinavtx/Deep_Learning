For improving neural networks performance:
1. Overfitting
-> Dropout Layers
-> Regularization (L1 & L2)
-> Early Stopping

2. Normalization
-> Normalizing Inputs (Feature Scaling)
-> Batch Normalization
-> Normalizing activations

3. Vanishing Gradients
-> Activation Function
-> Weight Initialisation

4. Gradient Checking and Clipping

5. Optimizers
